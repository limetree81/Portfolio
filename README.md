# Take my hand - Simple Plan

hey hey hey hey hey hey

Sometimes I feel like everybody\`s got a problem

Sometimes I feel like nobody wants to solve them

I know that people say they\`ll never gonna make it

But I know they just don\`t understand

Close your eyes and please don\`t let me go go go don\`t let me go now

Close your eyes don\`t make me let you go don\`t don\`t

Take my hands tonight

Let\`s not think about tomorrow

Take my hands tonight

We could find some place to go

Cuz out hearts are locked forever and our love will never die

Take my hand tonight one last time

hey hey hey hey hey hey

Rain drops the tears keep fallen

I see your face and it keeps me going

If I get lost your light\`s gonna guide me

But I know that you can take me home

You can take me home

Take my hand tonight

Let\`s not think about tomorrow

Take my hand tonight

We could find some place to go

Cause our hearts are locked forever and our love will never die

Take my hand tonight one last time

Take my hand tonight

Let\`s not think about tomorrow

Take my hand tonight

We could find some place to go

Cause our hearts are locked forever and our love will never die

Take my hand tonight one last time



# Disenchanted - My Chemical Romance

\<Verse\><br>
Well I was there on the day

they sold the cause for the queen

and when the lights all went out

we watched our lives on the screen

I hate the ending myself

But it started with an alright scene

It was the roar of the crowd

that gave me heartache to sing

It was a lie when they smiled

and said you won\`t feel a thing

and as we ran from the cops

we laughed so hard that it would sting

Yeah yeah ohhh

\<Pre hook\><br>
If I\`m so wrong

How can you listen all night long

Now will it matter long after I\`m gone

Because never lean a god damn thing

\<Hook\><br>
You\`re just a sad song with nothing to say

about a lifelong wait for a hospital stay

and if you think that I\`m wrong

this never meant nothing to you

\<Verse\><br>
I spent my high school career

spit on and shoved to agree

So I could watch all my heros sell a car on TV.

Bring out the old guilotine

We\`ll show \`em what we all mean

Yeah, ohhh

\<Pre hook\><br>
If I\`m so wrong

How can you listen all night long

Now will it matter long after I\`m gone

Because never lean a god damn thing

\<Hook\><br>
You\`re just a sad song with nothing to say

about a lifelong wait for a hospital stay

and if you think that I\`m wrong

this never meant nothing to you

\<?\><br>
So go, go away

Just go, run away

But where did you run to

and where did you hide

go find another way

price you pay

Hey woah yeah, woah yeah woah woah woah woah

\<Hook\><br>
You\`re just a sad song with nothing to say

about a lifelong wait for a hospital stay

and if you think that I\`m wrong

this never meant nothing to you

You\`re just a sad song with nothing to say

about a lifelong wait for a hospital stay

and if you think that I\`m wrong

this never meant nothing to you

at all, at all, at all, at all...


# Lie to Me - 5 Seconds of Summer
\<Verse\><br>
I saw you looking brand new overnight

I caught you looking too but you didn\`t look twice

You look happy, oh oh

You look happy, ohhh

\<Hook\><br>
Flashing back to New York City

Change your flight so you stay with me

Problem was thinking that I got this right

Now I wish we never met

Cause you\`re too hard to forget

While I\`m cleaning up your mess

Know he\`s taking off your dress

I know that you don\`t but if I ask you if you love me

I hope you lie lie lie lie lie to me

\<Verse\><br>
It\`s 3 A.M. and the moonlight\`s testing me

If I can make it to the dawn, then it won\`t be hard to see

I ain\`t happy Oh ohoh

I ain\`t too happy, ohhhh

\<Hook\><br>
Flashing back to New York City

Change your flight so you stay with me

Problem was thinking that I got this right

Now I wish we never met

Cause you\`re too hard to forget

While I\`m cleaning up your mess

Know he\`s taking off your dress

I know that you don\`t but if I ask you if you love me

I hope you lie lie lie lie lie to me

\<Outro\>

Singing La la la la
la la la la la la
la la la la la la
la la la la la la

I know that you don`t but if I ask you if you love me

I hope you lie lie lie lie lie to me
